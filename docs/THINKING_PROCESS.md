# Thought Process & Approach

This document outlines my approach to tackling this coding challenge. It covers the initial research, goal setting, key decisions, and reflections made throughout the process. My aim is to provide transparency into how I work and problem-solve, offering insight into both my technical methods and my perspective as a developer.

## 1. Initial Research & Context Gathering

Before diving into the code, I gathered broader context about Vizzuality and its development practices:

*   **GitHub Exploration:** I reviewed the [Vizzuality GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Vizzuality) to understand common technologies, project structures, and contribution patterns.
*   **Discovering Resources:** This exploration led me to useful internal documentation and resources, including:
    *   The [Front-end Scaffold Docs](https://front-end-scaffold-docs.vercel.app/)
    *   Insights from [Devismos](https://vizzuality.github.io/devismos/docs/frontismos/strategy-2021/initiatives-directory/hiring-proposal/) regarding development strategy.
    *   The detailed [Frontend Engineer Role Description (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVeHYs6wOqRqQriZE7Y68JCNycXokVJX3K9y7d5t8mQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ql8npoan2zxg), which provided valuable specifics.

## 2. Goal Setting: Targeting Mid-Level Requirements

Based on the challenge description and the role details, I set a clear objective for this project:

*   **Target:** Successfully implement all features and requirements specified for the **Mid/Senior Developer** level.
*   **Motivation:** I view this challenge as an opportunity to demonstrate skills and a problem-solving approach consistent with a Mid-level role, even if my tenure differs from typical timelines. I aimed to showcase my capabilities thoroughly.

## 3. Defining and Tracking Requirements

To ensure all goals were met systematically:

*   **Action:** I created a dedicated requirements checklist document (`docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`).
*   **Method:** This involved carefully parsing the official challenge text, cross-referencing with details from the role description, and structuring everything into a clear checklist format targeting the Mid/Senior specifications.
*   **Purpose:** This `REQUIREMENTS.md` file served as my primary guide and progress tracker throughout the development process, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the required functionalities.
